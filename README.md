# Fundamentals-of-Data-Analysis


## Description

This repository was created to complete the assessment for Fundamentals of Data Analysis course by utilising Jupyter notebooks.

## How to install the notebook

You need to run this notebook in python environment (please refer to packages and dependencies in requirements.txt file) the easiest way to do that is to install Anaconda
1. Download [Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/index.html). If not using Anaconda can install packages via ***pip install / homebrew install*** (Example: pip install matplotlib).
2. Download [cmder](https://cmder.net) if using Windows. Or use Terminal if on macOS or Linux.

## How to run the notebook

1. Open terminal / cmder.
2. Run command `jupyter notebook` or `jupyter lab` from command line. It's a web application which runs on your local machine (you will be able to see the server running in Terminal/cmder). To stop the application running press control+c and then type 'y' to confirm.
3. The browser page should open up automatically. Select the file you would like to view.


## Explore

There are two main files in this repository: 

`pyplot.ipynb` provides an overview of the `matplotlib.pyplot` Python package by demonstrating how to create a simple plot. It also explains in detail how to create 3 different types of plots: ***'bmh' style histogram, bar chart on polar axis and hexagonal binned plot***. You can edit the parameters of the plots to see different effects.

You can view the notebook in static or dynamic form by clicking the following images:

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/angelinka/Fundamentals-of-Data-Analysis.git/HEAD?labpath=pyplot.ipynb)

`cao.ipynb` demonstrates how to load and read points from Central Applications Office (CAO) into `pandas` data frame for years 2021, 2020 and 2019. As for each of those years information on cao websites is stored in different formats (html, excel and pdf) different packages and technics are used to extract it. A comparison and analyses of the data provided with help of various plots.
