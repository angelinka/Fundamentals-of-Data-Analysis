    "### Pyplot\n",
    "**Pyplot** is a Matplotlib module which provides a MATLAB-like interface. Matplotlib is designed to be as usable as MATLAB, with the ability to use Python and the advantage of being free and open-source. Each pyplot function makes some change to a figure: e.g., creates a figure, creates a plotting area in a figure, plots some lines in a plotting area, decorates the plot with labels, etc. The various plots we can utilize using Pyplot are **Line Plot, Histogram, Scatter, 3D Plot, Image, Contour,** and **Polar.** [1]\n",
